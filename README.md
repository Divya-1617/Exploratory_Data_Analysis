-COVID-19 Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Dataset
ðŸ“Š A comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic trends, patterns, and impacts using Python and data visualization tools.

1. Project Overview
This project explores the COVID-19 pandemic data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
Key objectives include:

Analyzing case growth, recovery, and death rates globally and by country/region.
Identifying countries with the highest and lowest impact.
Visualizing the spread and progression of the pandemic.

Hereâ€™s a detailed and professional README for your COVID-19 EDA Project. You can customize it further based on your project specifics.
